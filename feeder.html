                        <p>One of the biggest things I see making a difference for people in the future is Automation. The premise of being able to make machines do our uninspired work can mean the world to our future generations. I see this as something I might want to pursue in the future, and to get an idea of automating a process, I decided to make an automatic water feeder. I know, not many applications, but I figured I could get some use out of an extra Arduino I had laying around.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I sought out to answer the following questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How much would it cost me to implement an automated watering process?</li>
                            <li>How long would it take for my investment to pay itself off (in time saved)?</li>
                        Then, in reflection,
                            <li>How would my situation be different from a business standpoint?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I knew I could use the Arduino for the 'brain' of the thing, but I had little with accomplishing this sort of task. So, I looked to the trusty ol' Google for some guidance. Sure enough, I was able to find a guide on how to control something called a "solenoid valve" with my Arduino board. This seemed to be exactly what I needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the guidance to get through the hard part on lock down, I was ready to plan out what materials I would need in order to put the master plan into place. So I thought to myself, "What would an automatic water feeder look like?" From there, I determined the parts that my little project would require, and their prices:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A solenoid valve - $15</li>
                            <li>A container to put the water in - $2.50</li>
                            <li>Some adapters to connect the container to the solenoid valve and to the tubing - $10</li>
                            <li>Some tubing to direct the water into my plant's pot - $7.50</li>
                            <li>An arduino board with the electronics required to control the solenoid valve - $33</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                        The total price coming to $68, but I only paid $46 because I already had my arduino. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the coming days, I ordered my solenoid valve online, visited an electronics store, and took a trip over to the Home Depot. I decided to simply order the exact same solenoid valve as was in the guide, but this came back to bite me in the ass. I'll have more on that later. Everything went smoothly at the electronics store, though I'm sure I looked very clueless to the employees who helped me. And I spent a good 25 minutes looking at random hose adapters at Home Depot before asking for some assistance on how I could connect my container to my valve. Alex was very helpful with giving me some ideas, so thanks, Alex.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With all the pieces to the puzzle, I was ready to begin the assembly. I started with wiring up the arduino to ensure that the valve functioned before attaching the container and tubing. After about an hour of following a wiring diagram, plugging wires into the arduino holes, and uploading code to the arduino, I was able to get the valve to start opening and closing, though it was really quiet. I went on anyway and attached the tube to the valve to start putting some water in, but something wasn't right. The water just fell through the valve and never stopped. I tested it 5 more times just to convince myself that I had somehow made an error in the process. I had to go back to the drawing board, and by that, I mean to the guide. Turns out I needed to connect it to an outlet because my computer didn't give it enough power. So I did, and thankfully it was much louder when opening and closing the valve. I was thinking pretty highly of myself at this point, as I had successfully troubleshooted and was well on my way to embracing the automation life. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was time to rinse and repeat, to prove to myself that I could, in fact, do it. I reattached the tube and poured water down it. The valve was audibly opening and closing, but to my surprise, the water still didn't stop. Frustrated was an understatement. I tried it again. Still no stoppage. Again. Same result. Einstein's quote ran through my head, "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results." I wasn't about to lose my mind to this crappy little valve. I went back to the guide, this time realizing there were comments. I read through nearly all of them, until at the end, I found some poor chap with the same issue. Mr.Geek-Man who wrote the post failed to mention that in order for this valve to operate, it needed 3 PSI of pressure on the valve. This is the equivalent of storing your water 7 FEET above the valve. Who freaking does that? I was pissed, but I did have a feeling, deep down, that this would no go quite as I had imagined. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Nonetheless, I was still ready to keep going. I discovered that what I would need was not your (somehow) common, everyday, stores your water 7 feet in the air, solenoid valve. What I needed was a "direct acting" solenoid valve, a valve that required 0 PSI to operate. I was left with no choice but to visit the eBay in order to find a reasonable deal on this new valve, as I had already spent more on this project that I had originally thought. The best deal I could find was for $25, bringing the total up to $78. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        In the next couple of days, the valve had shipped and was on my doorstep. I took that junk in and connected it to my arduino. Thankfully, it worked with the same wiring as the other valve; I immediately heard it opening and closing. It was the moment of truth. I attached the tube to the new valve, and poured water down the hole. God bless it, the water actually stopped. I was half preparing myself for another failure, so that was a big relief. The next steps were to modify the Arduino code to only open for a few seconds every few days, and then to assemble the contraption. Modifying the code was surprisingly easy and only took a few minutes, and the assembly was equally as simple as I already had all the parts I needed. And just like that, I had myself an automatic water feeder.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        From start to finish, this process was somewhat painful to plan out, especially with the whole, 'buying the wrong valve' part, but once figuring out everything I needed, I would say it was pretty easy to implement. This could easily be replicated if it needed to be. I now, through the fury of automating a water feeder, will revisit the questions I sought to answer at the beginning of my journey. Starting with:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How much would it cost me to implement an automated watering process?</li>
                            <p>
                            Easy, I already figured this one out. My total came out to be $78 with the new valve. Though this seemed like a lot for this collegiate broke boy, it probably isn't too bad for anyone making a decent salary. 
                            </p>
                            <li>How long would it take for my investment to pay itself off (in time saved)?</li>
                            <p>
                            The overall process, including the trips to the different stores and troubleshooting, probably took me somewhere around 12 hours. If I had known all the parts that I needed it would not have been anywhere near that. It honestly could be done in 3 hours if I had to do it again. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            In order to calculate whether the time savings I would now be able to take advantage of would be worth the cost, I factored in my wage to the amount of time it takes to water my plant. So if it takes about 5 minutes to pick it up, spread the water evenly around, and put back, and I make $8.50 per hour, it would take 110 waterings to pay off the $78. That's not too shabby. It would pay itself off in time saved in a little less than a year, and much less if you earn decent money. I would say that's worth it overall! 
                            </p>
                            <li>How would my situation be different from a business standpoint?</li>
                            <p>
                            In a business environment, such as a plant nursery, one would probably be able to get more of a discount on the parts they purchase, as it would likely be in bulk. They would also be able to save even more money as they would be saving more time watering every plant than just one like in my situation. In a business environment, automating a process like this seems even more reasonable than doing it for just one small use case. 
                            </p>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Through putting myself through this process, I've learned a lot about what it would takes to implement automation. I think the fact that I, a freshman in college, was able to do it says a lot about the future of automation. I think that because it is relatively easy to do, more and more businesses will end up automating what they can, and the world may look very different from how it does now in the next 50 years.
